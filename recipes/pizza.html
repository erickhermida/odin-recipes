    <h1>How to make Pizza</h1>
    <img src="image.jpeg" alt="Pizza">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Instead of ordering pizza for your next party, wow your guests with these crispy, caramelized, pizza-flavored cheese chips!</p>
    <p>Since everybody agrees that the best parts of a pizza are those spots where the cheese sort of drips off and caramelizes onto the pan, getting crispy, crusty, and incredibly delicious, I took those cheesy drips and made chips! Serve as-is or top with a bit of baby arugula and fold in half to eat like tacos.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared pizza sauce</li>
        <li>30 slices pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 13x18-inch, half-sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Grate provolone and mozzarella cheeses with the larger side of a box grater into a large bowl. Use the smaller side and grate in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Toss with your hands to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoonfuls of the cheese mixture into 12 circular piles on the prepared baking sheet, making sure you're getting all three cheeses in each scoop. Top each circle with about ¾ teaspoon pizza sauce, then place a slice of pepperoni on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until melted and sizzling, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove parchment paper and chips to a wire rack to cool. Line the baking sheet with a fresh sheet of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to bake remaining 18 chips.</li>
        <li>Let chips cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the parchment paper and serve.</li>
    </ol>
